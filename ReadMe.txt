%% Running the model, generating the Data corresponding to data presented in the manuscript

To Run the CircAdapt Model as described in the Methods section execute and follow the instructions provided by the following script:

>>CircAdaptMain.m

To Run the Batch of CircAdapt simulations corresponding to the parameter sweeps as detailed in the "Simulation Protocols" section exectute the script:

>>CircAdaptBatchCall.m

Note that a folder with name "Simulations" will automatically be generated to contain the 153 (=17*9) simulations

%% Generating the plots and tables corresponding to those presented in the manuscript

To generate a figure or table as presented in the manuscript, evaluate the following scripts:

>>Generate_Fig4_Table1.m
>>Generate_Fig5ab.m
>>Generate_Fig5ab.m
>>Generate_Fig6.m
